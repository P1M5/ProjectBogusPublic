### Project Bogus

# Project Bogus is a successful attempt at ai integration for the social media age. It represents a complete workflow from downloading a video to converting it to an engaging subtitled short using transcription,diarization and a LLM. It has been practically proven to be effective.
# It was written in a Jupyter Notebook hence the single script file. There are definitely areas we can see improvement in but it gave me practical experience to create projects from conceiving the idea, reasoning through how it would be made, exploring competition, fixing inefficiencies
# and bugs to finally a working product. I will NOT be working or supporting this project at all.
#
# Areas where it can see improvement:
# - OOP adherence
# - Better prompt engineering
# - Better subtitle implementation with customizations
# - Custom LLM
# - Multithreading

# If you want to try this project on your own computer you will have to find the required python libraries and configure it on your own. **It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you use Linux**
